Information about UI:

  1. During the initial phases of testing the application worked for Amazon, Etsy and Ebay. It was able to show a comparison in a merged chart. Though through further investigation I found out that Amazon and Etsy do not allow webscraping. Given that I have not updated the code to bypass their restrictions and honor their guidlines. So currently the only valid option through the UI is Ebay.
  2. Insert the item you would like to search in the search bar after selecting Ebay from the drop down then press submit.
  3. If you would like to reset the amount of bars shown type below by the reset index button and click reset index button. The initial results after will be all results click the index buttons to review your grouped results. Example would be if total results was 60, you can type 20 in the reset index button and click the button. Then click 0 index it will show the first 20 items sorted highest priced to lowest and click 1 to select next 20 results ext..
